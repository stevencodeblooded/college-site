      <h1>About Our Founder</h1>
      <p>Michelle Tiller enrolled at Georgia Piedmont Technical College (GPTC) in her 40s, earning an Associate of Applied Science in Business Management. She immersed herself in the GPTC community through student clubs and campus organizations and received national recognition as an award-winning public speaker. In her early days as a student, she struggled to ask for help but eventually learned that success in college requires a strong support system.</p>
      <p>Shari Smith, GPTC’s Student Activities Director, played a pivotal role by mentoring Michelle, encouraging her to join executive boards and compete in student leadership competitions. Michelle won first place in a national customer service and client relations competition through FBLA (formerly Phi Beta Lambda). After graduating, she received life coaching from Cynthia Culbreath through Partners in Change, who supported her transition and growth.</p>
      <p>Michelle then began working in GPTC’s Student Affairs department, gaining experience in admissions, financial aid, academic advising, and case management. She founded College Bound Scholars, Inc. to help adult learners, first-generation students, and non-traditional applicants navigate college and career readiness with encouragement and guidance from someone who’s been there. Now pursuing her MBA, Michelle remains committed to walking alongside those just beginning their own journeys.</p>
